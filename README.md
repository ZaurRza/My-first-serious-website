# My-first-serious-website
It's my first serious project with employer and backender in my team. I had to do only frontend part. In this website I used a few interesting technologies such as creating articles, taking a code from articles and so on.
In this project I used react frame work. This website is about articles related on programming language. People on this website can learn some basements of coding and share their fascinating ideas.
